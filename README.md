# web3-to-butt

![Example replacements: "What can you do in My Butt?", "web2 monetizes attention, my butt monetizes passion"](sample.png)

Chrome extension that replaces occurrences of 'web3' with 'my butt' or a reasonable-sounding variant.

This is forked from the infamous [cloud-to-butt](https://github.com/panicsteve/cloud-to-butt) by @panicsteve.

## Installation

While I get on working this approved for the Chrome store, the easiest way to use this is to clone this repo, and load it as an unpacked extension in developer mode in Chrome.

## Safari Version

I do not want to use Xcode so feel free to make a Safari version.

## Firefox Version

I am lazy so feel free to make a Firefox version.
